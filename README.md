## NETFLIX CLONE
This project is a demonstration of a Netflix-inspired app built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. The goal of this project is to replicate key features and user experience elements of the popular streaming service, allowing users to explore and interact with a catalog of movies and TV shows.
 
## Pre-requests
- Create an account if you don't have one on TMDB. Because I use its free API to consume movie/TV data.
- And then follow the documentation to create an API Key
- Finally, if you use v3 of TMDB API, add API KEY in a constant file so you can experience the demo smoothly
